### PROJECT EXPERIENCE  
**Customer Loyalty Analysis: DSN Telecom Customer Churn**  
o	Analyze customer loyalty in 3 dimensions: demographics, service subscriptions and account information, then use supervised learning to predict customer churn based on these features  
o	Load CSV file, identify data and perform data manipulation on categorical data for exploratory data analysis, modelling, and visualize data in pie charts, percentage stack bar charts, side by side histogram  
o	Analyze services subscription rate by groups, and customer account information, identify problems on current services products, discover more business opportunities on existing clients, and provide suggestions for A/B tests  
o	SVM algorithm yields F1 score 0.78, provide suggestions to further improve model performance  

**Recommendation System: Movie Recommendation Engine**  
o	Use Natural Language Processing technique to analyze large sample of text data on the movie plots and recommend the most similar movies to users  
o	Perform data identification, check missing values, remove duplicate values, and data preparation  
o	Create TfidfVectorizer using defined tokenizer, remove stop words, then fit and transform on tokenized movie plot to generate tfidf matrix, and introduce cosine similarity to calculate pairwise similarity scores on each movie plot  
o	Get input of movie title from user, locate row number in similarity scores matrix, rank elements on the row to get top 10 most similar movies
